# Angular Todo

A very basic Angular application based on chapter 2 in the book 'Pro Angular 9' by Adam Freeman (Apress, 2020).

>A simple Angular application that will manage a to-do list. The user will be able to see the list of to-do items, check off items that are complete, and create new items. To keep the application simple, I assume that there is
only one user and that I donâ€™t have to worry about preserving the state of the data in the application, which
means that changes to the to-do list will be lost if the browser window is closed or reloaded.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.3.

## Prerequisites

## Run
